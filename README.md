## Machine Learning Modelling Pipelines in Production

### Week 5: 

#### Explainable AI

- Responsible AI
    - Faireness
    - Explainablity
    - Privacy
    - Secrurity

- Explainable Aritificial Intelligence (XAI)
    - Importance of explanations:
        - To ensure algorithmic faireness
        - Identify potential bias and problems in the training data
        - To ensure algorihms/models works as expected.

    - Need for Exaplainability in AI
        - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be fooled into misclassifying inputs with no resemblance to the true category.

#### Interpretability

What is intergretability:
    
    (Models) are interrepatable if their operations can be understood by a human, either through introspection or through a produced explanation.

Categorizing Model Interpretation Methods:

- Intrinsic or Post-Hoc

- Model Specific or Model Agnostic

- Local or Global
